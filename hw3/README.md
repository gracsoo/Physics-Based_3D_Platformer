Simple Obstacles:
- Spinner
- Sweeper

Medium Obstacles:
- Slippery Ramp
- Rolling Obstacles Ramp

Observations:
- Setting up the ragdoll was a bit challenging-the collider of the empty object was colliding with the body parts' colliders, which caused jitterings of the player
- the medium obstacles were hard to play through for me
